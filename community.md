# Community
Most of our ongoings take place on the [discord server](https://discord.gg/h5r77Sa), so come on over and say hi if you're interested.

Our source code is on [GitHub](https://github.com/EhWhoAmI/cqsp). Instructions on how to compile are in the README of the file.

Our game also exists on itch.io, [here](https://ehwhoami.itch.io/conquer-space), where releases and screenshots of the game will put there periodically.
