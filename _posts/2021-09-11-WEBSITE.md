# Website

Hi, Conquer Space now has a website and a domain, at <http://cqsp.ehwhoami.com>.

I'll try working on adding more content over time, but I'm not very consistent in doing those
kinds of things. The main goals for this website will be to introduce new players to the game, and
even have a sort of tutorial for the game. But for now, it'll have to be rather bare bones as we
work on the game.

We will also add dev diaries every now and then here to document some of our progress and note down
some of our thoughts, but that'll be for later when we have something interesting to show.
